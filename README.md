Balaam is a server built to collate and manage your TMUX status bar. By default, TMUX refreshes every
5 seconds, making any dashboard difficult to manage without some level of cache. Balaam manages
several gnarly data sources to give you a snapshot of what you absolute have to know at any instant.

Current Integrations:

1. Weather
2. Slack Mentions and Unread counts
3. Github Notifications, Mentions, and CI Status

Soon to come Integrations:

1. Gitter
2. Circle CI
3. StatusPage
4. GMail

### What's in a name?
Balaam is named for an Oracle in the Bible who was hired out by foreign kings tell them what
they already knew, but didn't want to deal with. Also, he gets owned by a talking jackass. So he's
got that going for him, which is nice.

#### Hat Tip
Thanks to [@pengwynn](https://twitter.com/pengwynn) for starting me off down the TMUX path. And thanks to [@barrettclark](https://twitter.com/barrettclark) for his initial post about including weather in his TMUX status bar that got me thinking about all of this.
